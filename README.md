# some dotfiles

Not sure why you'd care, but these are my dotfiles

---

I recently switched to NixOS, and these are my current dotfiles..... that's about it.

---

## Details
- NixOS (obviously)
- Hyprland
- Firefox (backup browser)
- Chromium (my school requires it)
- Tor Browser (for finding Linux ISOs)
- Tailscale
- Nvidia open drivers
- NeoVim
- Waybar
- Distrobox
- Konsole (just a preference)
- Dolphin (another preference)
- Kate (too lazy to find a better GUI code editor, NeoVim is too good)
- Hyprshot
