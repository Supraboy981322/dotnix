# some dotfiles

Not sure why you'd care, but these are my dotfiles

These are my current dotfiles for NixOS..... that's about it.

---

## Details
- NixOS (obviously)
- Hyprland
- Zen Browser (not part of config, only `.desktop` file for now)
- Firefox (backup browser)
- Chromium (my school requires it)
- Tor Browser (for finding Linux ISOs)
- Tailscale 
- Nvidia open drivers (Nvidia sucks, I don't have money to buy a new GPU) 
- NeoVim (the superior code editor)
- Waybar
- Distrobox
- Ghostty (trying it out, I also have Konsole configured to my preferences)
- Dolphin (another preference)
- Kate (too lazy to find a better GUI code editor, NeoVim is too good)
- Hyprshot
